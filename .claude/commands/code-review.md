# Code Review Guidelines
## Review Categories

### 游댮 **Critical Issues** (Must Fix)
Issues that could cause bugs, security vulnerabilities, or system failures.

- **Logic Errors**: Incorrect conditional statements, off-by-one errors, infinite loops
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: SQL injection, XSS, hardcoded secrets, unsafe eval usage
- **Resource Leaks**: Unclosed file handles, database connections, memory leaks
- **Race Conditions**: Concurrent access without proper synchronization
- **Error Handling**: Swallowed exceptions, unhandled promise rejections

### 游리 **Major Issues** (Should Fix)
Issues that impact maintainability, performance, or user experience.

- **Code Duplication**: Copy-pasted code that should be extracted into reusable functions
- **Performance Issues**: Inefficient algorithms, N+1 queries, unnecessary re-renders
- **API Design**: Breaking changes without deprecation warnings, inconsistent REST patterns
- **Testing**: Missing test coverage for critical paths, flaky tests
- **Dependencies**: Outdated packages with known vulnerabilities

### 游릭 **Minor Issues** (Consider Fixing)
Issues related to code style and minor improvements.

- **Naming Conventions**: Inconsistent variable names, unclear abbreviations
- **Code Style**: Indentation, spacing, line length violations
- **Documentation**: Missing JSDoc, outdated comments, typos in documentation
- **File Organization**: Misplaced files, inconsistent directory structure

## Common Issues by Language

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Async/Await**: Proper error handling, no unhandled promise rejections

- **React**: Proper hook dependencies, no stale closures, key props on lists
- **Node.js**: Proper async error handling, no blocking operations

### Python
- **PEP 8**: Adherence to style guide, proper naming conventions
- **Type Hints**: Use modern type annotations
- **Imports**: No circular imports, proper import organization
- **Error Handling**: Specific exception types, proper logging

### Shell/Bash
- **Quoting**: Proper variable quoting to prevent word splitting
- **Error Handling**: `set -euo pipefail` usage, proper exit codes
- **Portability**: Avoid bashisms if targeting POSIX sh
- **Safety**: Validate inputs, avoid eval when possible

## Review Comments Format

### Suggested Comment Template
```
**[LEVEL] Brief Issue Description**

Current issue: [Specific problem with line reference]

Suggestion: [Concrete improvement suggestion]

Reasoning: [Why this change improves the code]

Example:
```language
// Before
[problematic code]

// After  
[improved code]
```

**[LEVEL]** = 游댮 CRITICAL / 游리 MAJOR / 游릭 MINOR
```

### Examples of Good Comments

#### 游댮 Critical Issue
```
**游댮 CRITICAL SQL Injection Vulnerability**

Current issue: Direct string concatenation in SQL query at `src/auth.js:45`

Suggestion: Use parameterized queries

Reasoning: Prevents SQL injection attacks

Example:
```javascript
// Before
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${email}'`

// After
const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?'
db.query(query, [email])
```
```

#### 游리 Major Issue
```
**游리 MAJOR Performance Issue**

Current issue: N+1 query problem in `getUserPosts()` function at `src/api/users.js:123`

Suggestion: Use eager loading or JOIN query

Reasoning: Reduces database round trips from N+1 to 1

Example:
```javascript
// Before
const users = await getUsers()
const userPosts = users.map(user => getPosts(user.id))

// After
const usersWithPosts = await getUsers({ include: 'posts' })
```
```

#### 游릭 Minor Issue
```
**游릭 MINOR Naming Convention**

Current issue: Variable `tmp` doesn't describe its purpose at `src/utils.js:78`

Suggestion: Rename to `temporaryFilePath`

Reasoning: Improves code readability and self-documentation
```

## Review Process

### 1. Automated Checks First
Run these before human review:
- Linting (ESLint, Pylint, Shellcheck)
- Type checking (TypeScript, mypy)
- Unit tests
- Security scanning (npm audit, bandit)
- Formatting checks (Prettier, black)

### 2. Systematic Review Approach
1. **High-level overview**: Understand the change purpose
2. **Architecture**: Check if the approach fits the system design
3. **Implementation**: Review the actual code changes
4. **Tests**: Verify test coverage and quality
5. **Documentation**: Check for necessary updates
6. **Edge cases**: Consider unusual scenarios

### 3. Review Response Guidelines
- **Author**: Acknowledge all feedback, ask for clarification if needed
- **Reviewer**: Be constructive, explain the "why" behind suggestions
- **Resolution**: Mark comments as resolved when addressed
- **Follow-up**: Create tickets for larger refactoring tasks
